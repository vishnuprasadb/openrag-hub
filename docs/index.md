# OpenRAG-Hub

**OpenRAG-Hub** is an open-source, self-hosted Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that allows teams to query their internal knowledge through a Web UI or Slack.

It is designed to be:
- 🔓 Open-source and reusable
- 🧩 Modular and pluggable
- 🏠 Self-hosted and privacy-friendly
- 💬 Accessible via Web UI and Slack
- 🧠 Built with real-world engineering constraints in mind

## Why OpenRAG-Hub?

Most teams want to:
- Chat with internal documents
- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Control their data
- Integrate with existing tools like Slack

OpenRAG-Hub provides a **clean, extensible foundation** to do exactly that — without hardcoding assumptions about models, storage, or deployment.
